### Streamlit Examples 

This is my first attempt with [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/). It is an open-source framework, free, Python-based and easy to use tool to build and deploy data-driven and machine learning applications. This repo was started in a nice and sunny weekend in Aberdeen, during the lockdown and when #stayAthome was trending on twitter and elsewhere. 

#### Requirements 


* You need to have Python installed on your machine 
* You need to have streamlit installed, if not, simply issue the following command  

```
$pip install streamlit
```
